# ETHO DID Specification Draft v0.1 - NebuIA

## Abstract

This specification describes a new DID method for hosting DIDs on the Ethereum blockchain, also referred to as ETHO DID. This specification conforms to the requirements specified in the [DIDs specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) currently published by the W3C Credentials Community Group.

## Conformance and Terminology

This specification assumes a fair degree of understanding of [W3C DIDs specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/).

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [IETF RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119).

## ETHO DID Syntax

ETHO DID is a URI conforming to [IETF RFC 3986](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986) and **SHOULD** be generated by each entity itself.

ETHO DID is generated in conformity with [W3C DIDs specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/).

The ABNF grammar used to generate the ETHO DID identifier is as follows:

```
etho-did   = "did:etho:" etho-specific-idstring
etho-specific-idstring = 40*40HEXDIG
```

`did:etho:` denotes that ETHO DIDs are decentralized identifiers conforming to [W3C DIDs specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/), and are  registered on the Ethereum blockchain.

Below is an example of a ETHO DID:

```
did:etho:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121
```

## ETHO DID Registration and Deactivation

ETHO DID can be automatically generated without registration for each Ethereum address.

When a ETHO DID is deactivated, all the related data including public keys, controllers, and other properties will be deleted and only a record of the ETHO DID identifier will remain on the Ethereum blockchain.

A deactivated ETHO DID can no longer be used and cannot be reactivated for use.

## ETHO DID Document

Each ETHO DID will have a corresponding ETHO DID Document, which is a set of data describing this ETHO DID.

Below is the basic structure of the ETHO DID Document:

```json
{
  "@context": ["https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1"],
  "id": "did:etho:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121",
  "publicKey": [...],
  "authentication": [...],
  "controller": [...],
  "service": [...],
  "updated": "..."
}
```

### Context

ETHO DID Documents **MUST** include a `@context` property.

The value of the @context property **MUST** be one or more URIs, where the value of the first URI **MUST** be [https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1](https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1). For more information, see [W3C DIDs specification](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/#production-0).

Below is an example in which the `@context` property has two values:

```json
{
  "@context": ["https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1"]
}
```

### Identifiers

ETHO DID Documents **MUST** include an `id` property.

The value of the `id` property denotes the ETHO DID subject that the ETHO DID Document is about.

The value of `id` **MUST** be a valid ETHO DID. A ETHO DID **MUST** have exactly one DID subject.

```json
{
  "id": "did:etho:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121"
}
```

### Public Keys

A ETHO DID Document **MAY** include a `publicKey` property to specify a set of public keys linked to that ETHO DID.

Public and private key pairs can be used for the identity management, authorization, and verification of ETHO DIDs. A ETHO DID can be linked to multiple public and private key pairs and one pair of public and private keys can also be used to manage multiple ETHO DIDs.

Every public key object linked to the `publicKey` property **MUST** include the fields `id`, `type`, `controller`  and specific public key properties, and **MAY** include other additional properties.

Each linked public key has its own identifier specified using the field `id`. The value of `publicKey` **MUST NOT** contain multiple entries with the same `id`.

Bound public keys can be revoked. Revoked public keys **MUST NOT** be reactivated, but can still possess the original `id`.

The value of the `type` field represents the corresponding public key type. ETHO DID Documents support `EcdsaSecp256k1RecoveryMethod2020` and `EcdsaSecp256k1VerificationKey2019`.

The value of the `controller` field which identifies the controller of the corresponding private key **MUST** be a valid ETHO DID, implying that the public key is controlled by this ETHO DID.

The encoding formats that ETHO DID Documents support include `publicKeyHex` and `ethAddress`. Public keys of all types **MUST** be expressed in these two formats.

Below is a specific example of the `publicKey` property:

```json
{
  "publicKey": [
	{
	  "id": "did:etho:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121#keys-1",
	  "type": "EcdsaSecp256k1VerificationKey2019",
	  "controller": "did:etho:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121",
	  "publicKeyHex": "0xfbf38de9fb40edcdab412094d24fa39a314f3d3f52f5860e2509c32522eda30161fe70dfc9f90434d64bd976ede4f112d4f2d8e34d28fe48281663219d2ddac6"
	},
	{
	  "id": "did:etho:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121#keys-1",
	  "type": "EcdsaSecp256k1RecoveryMethod2020",
	  "controller": "did:etho:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121",
	  "ethAddress": "0xf269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121"
	}
  ]
}
```

### Authentication

ETHO DID Documents **SHOULD** include an `authentication` property to specify a set of verification methods.

A ETHO DID subject could add the `authentication` property in its corresponding ETHO DID Document to denote that the subject has authorized a set of verification methods for the purpose of authentication.

The associated value **MUST** be an ordered set of one or more verification methods. Each verification method in the `authentication` property **MAY** be embedded or referenced.

Below is an example which refers to authentication keys in the two way specified above:

```json
{
  ...
  "authentication": [
	"did:etho:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121#keys-1",
	{
	  "id": "did:etho:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121#keys-2",
	  "type": "EcdsaSecp256k1VerificationKey2019",
	  "controller": "did:etho:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121",
	  "publicKeyHex": "03a835599850544b4c0a222d594be5d59cf298f5a3fd90bff1c8caa064523745f3"
	}
  ],
}
```

### Authorization and Delegation

In a ETHO DID Document, an **OPTIONAL** `controller` property is included to assign one or more delegates.

A ETHO DID can be delegated to and controlled by one or more distinct ETHO DIDs.

A ETHO DID delegate has the necessary authorization to insert a new verification method into the `authentication` property of the delegated ETHO DID.

It is worth noting that a ETHO DID Document can assign `controller` without defining the value of `authentication`.

The ETHO DID Document of the delegate **SHOULD** have a `authentication` property.

Below is a specific example representing that either `did:etho:5Ee76017be7F983a520a778B413758A9DB49cBe9` or `did:etho:9861eE37Ede3dCab070DF227155D86A7438d8Ed2` can act as a delegate of `did:etho:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121`:

```json
{
  ...
  "id": "did:etho:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121",
  "controller": [
	"did:etho:5Ee76017be7F983a520a778B413758A9DB49cBe9",
	"did:etho:9861eE37Ede3dCab070DF227155D86A7438d8Ed2"
  ],
}
```

### Service Information

ETHO DID Documents use an **OPTIONAL** `service` property to specify the service property.

ETHO DID allows entities to add services and specify the relevant information of a service that is related to the particular ETHO DID, including fields such as the type of service and service endpoint.

This part is derived directly from [W3C DIDs specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#services).

Below is a specific example:

```json
{
  ...
  "service": [
	{
	  "id": "did:etho:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121#some-service",
	  "type": "SomeServiceType",
	  "serviceEndpoint": "Some URL"
	}
  ]
}
```

### Created

ETHO DID Documents do not include a `created` property as ETHO DID can be automatically generated for each Ethereum address.

### Updated

ETHO DID Documents **SHOULD** include an `updated` property to specify a timestamp of the most recent change.

This part is derived directly from [W3C DIDs specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#updated).

Below is a specific example:

```json
{
  "updated": "2019-06-30T12:00:00Z"
}
```

## Appendix

A simple example of a ETHO DID Document is as follows:

```json
{
  "@context": ["https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1", "https://www.eth.org/did/v1"],
  "id": "did:etho:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121",
  "publicKey": [
	{
	  "id": "did:etho:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121#keys-1",
	  "type": "EcdsaSecp256k1VerificationKey2019",
	  "controller": "did:etho:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121",
	  "publicKeyHex": "0xfbf38de9fb40edcdab412094d24fa39a314f3d3f52f5860e2509c32522eda30161fe70dfc9f90434d64bd976ede4f112d4f2d8e34d28fe48281663219d2ddac6"
	}
  ],
  "authentication": [
	"did:etho:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121#keys-1"
  ]
}
```
